# Password Email Manager
A python GUI for manage your password informations.

## Work principle
- When you click 'Add' the data will save to data.txt locally. 
- When you click 'Generate Password' the program will generate a password to you and it will copy to your clipboard to paste immediately
- The program wants confirmation for your entries.
- You must fill the all entries otherwise program will occur a warning
- You don't need to remember your passwords or nicknames or emails!

## Updates
- It does not store data in txt file anymore. I've updated to .json file for more efficiency.
- It has a search button now. You can find the website which you was registered.
